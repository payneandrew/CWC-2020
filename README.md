As an Engineering Student at James Madison University, my two year long capstone project is to design and fabricate a functional, small scale wind turbine to compete in the 2020 Collegiate Wind Competition in Boulder, Colorado. Utilizing 3D printers, microcontrolers, and other mechanical and electrical components we are designing a wind turbine that can maximize power at all wind speeds and perform other various tasks determined by the Department of Energy. To control the turbine, the team and I use microcontrollers to control the power output, braking, rpm, and data collection of the turbine. This repository houses code which is used to do so.
